# Maintainers guide

How to operate this repository day to day. This file is the **Maintainer** playbook — it does not restate the others:

- **Who** may do what + decision rules → [`GOVERNANCE.md`](../GOVERNANCE.md).
- **How contributors work** → [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 🧩 The moving parts

| Thing | Where | Note |
| ----- | ----- | ---- |
| Published plugins | `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + `plugins/` | the only thing shipped in a release |
| Live backlog & roadmap | [Project board #8](https://github.com/orgs/ai-driven-dev/projects/8) | single source of truth |
| Roles → access | GitHub teams `trusted-partners` / `certified-members` / `core-team` | mapped to the role ladder |
| Branch protection | ruleset "main protection" + `.github/rulesets/main.json` | `main` is PR-only |
| Releases | release-please (`ci.yml`) + `release-please-config.json` | 10 packages (root + 8 plugins + `cli`), auto |
| Pre-commit checks | `lefthook.yml` + `scripts/` | json/yaml/schema/frontmatter/catalogs/counts |

## 📅 Daily

- **Triage issues.** New issues auto-add to board #8. The form already stamped the type. You give the issue a **milestone** or a **priority**, never both.
- **Roadmap.** Priority = the community vote (mechanism in `GOVERNANCE.md`). Accepted items live on board #8 — keep `ROADMAP.md` a pointer, don't maintain a second list.
- **Review PRs.** Approve as CODEOWNERS, then squash-merge (merge policy → [`GOVERNANCE.md`](../GOVERNANCE.md#-code-decisions)).

## 📋 Four axes, one board

Each axis answers one question, and only `Status` lives on the board. Routing (`next`/`main`) is not an axis — it derives from the branch prefix ([routing table](../aidd_docs/memory/vcs.md#branches)).

| Axis | Lives in | Answers | Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Type** | issue type, stamped by the form | what kind of work | `Bug` · `Feature` · `Task` |
| **Milestone** | repo milestone | *when* it ships | one theme, due a Friday |
| **Priority** | org issue field | *in what order*, among what has no *when* | `Urgent` · `High` · `Medium` · `Low` |
| **Status** | board field | where the work stands | `Ideation` · `Todo` · `In Progress` · `In review` · `Done` |

Two rules keep the axes orthogonal:

- **A milestone or a priority, never both.** The milestone decided when; the order no longer matters.
- **The scope lives in the title**, conventional and queryable: `feat(aidd-pm): …`. No `Area` field, no scope label. Find work with `gh issue list --search 'aidd-pm in:title'`.

Status automation (Project → ⋯ → Workflows); `In Progress` is the one manual move:

| Trigger (built-in) | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Item added | `Todo` |
| PR linked / ready for review | `In review` |
| PR merged · item closed | `Done` |

The roadmap layout cannot read a milestone as a date, so the milestone view is a **Table view grouped by `Milestone`**. Its `No milestone` group is the backlog, ordered by `Priority`.

## 🏷️ Labels

Labels categorize nothing: the **issue type** does. A label in [`.github/labels.yml`](../.github/labels.yml) exists only when a bot or a human reads it — `good first issue`, `dependencies` (dependabot), `autorelease: *` (release-please).

Nothing syncs the file to GitHub. Create and delete by hand, then check they agree:

```bash
diff <(gh label list --repo ai-driven-dev/framework | cut -f1 | sort) \
     <(yq e '.[].name' .github/labels.yml | sort)
```

## 🚀 Releases

release-please opens/updates a `chore: release main` PR on each push to `main`.

1. (Optional) Review the version bumps + changelog. Authored by the **aidd-bot** App, so its checks run normally.
2. CI **auto-merges** it with the App token (`--squash --admin`); no human step needed. `--admin` is required because a plain `gh pr merge` is refused even for the bypass App.
3. CI tags each bumped package, creates the GitHub Releases, and attaches the bundles:
   - `aidd-framework-marketplace-X.Y.Z.zip` (`.claude-plugin/` + `plugins/`)
   - `<plugin>-vX.Y.Z.zip`
   - `aidd-framework-<tool>-<mode>-X.Y.Z.zip` - per-tool distributions (10 archives: 4 marketplace claude/cursor/copilot/codex + 6 flat incl. opencode and kilo), produced by the `build-per-tool` matrix job in `ci.yml`. It builds the CLI from this run's own checkout and runs `translate <source> --to <tool> --out <dir> --as <marketplace|flat>` — no published-version pin to bump.

Versions live in `.release-please-manifest.json`. Forcing a version / pre-release: `release-as` in `release-please-config.json` (remove it after the release ships).

## 🔄 Promotion & recovery

The weekly `next` → `main` promotion **must be a merge commit, never a squash and never a rebase**:

- A squash collapses the batch's conventional commits into one subject from the PR title. If that title isn't a valid conventional type, `Commitlint` fails on `main` and **release-please is skipped** — no release. `ci.yml` now lints the PR title itself on every pull request, the promote PR included, so a bad subject fails the promote PR's own `Commitlint` check before merge; the recovery below is the fallback, not the expected path. release-please attributes each commit to a package by the **path it touched** (`release-please-config.json`'s `packages` map), not by its scope, and a squash hides which paths the batch actually touched.
- A rebase keeps the commits but recopies them under new hashes, so git never records that the branches were reconciled. The merge base between `main` and `next` then goes stale, and every later back-merge conflicts on the release metadata release-please rewrites each time — a conflict with no real content behind it.
- A merge commit does both jobs: the commits land verbatim, and its second parent keeps a shared merge base so the back-merge stays clean.
- Use the **Promote next to main** workflow (it merges); merging by hand, pick **Create a merge commit** and give it a conventional subject.
- The Release PR release-please opens is its own single commit and is fine to squash.

**Recovery** — a bad squashed promote turns `main` red on `Commitlint` and skips **Release Please**. An admin:

1. Temporarily disables the `main protection` ruleset (Settings → Rules).
2. Force-pushes `main` back to the commit before the bad merge.
3. Re-enables the ruleset, then re-runs **Promote**.

## 📦 Dependencies (Dependabot)

- **Patch + minor bumps auto-merge** once checks pass (`.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml`, via the aidd-bot App).
- **Major bumps stay manual** — review, then `gh pr merge <n> --squash`.
- Several lockfile bumps queued: the first merges and the rest re-base automatically (or comment `@dependabot rebase`).

## 🔒 Branch protection & the bot bypass

The protection policy (PR-only, CODEOWNERS review, required checks) is defined in [`GOVERNANCE.md`](../GOVERNANCE.md#-code-decisions); this is the ops.

Two bypass actors (both `pull_request` mode, so neither can push directly to `main`):
- the **aidd-bot GitHub App** (`Integration`) - release-please and the Dependabot auto-merge mint a token from it (`actions/create-github-app-token`), so their PRs trigger the required checks *and* the App merges them past the human-review rule.
- the org's **`admin` team** (team id `11783938`, the actor the rulesets record) - lead maintainers can merge their own PR without a second review. Everyone else needs a code-owner review. It is a separate team from the three `GOVERNANCE.md` maps roles to, and confers no role of its own.

The App: ID in secret `AIDD_BOT_APP_ID`, key in `AIDD_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY`. If the App is broken/uninstalled, release and Dependabot PRs stop merging - fix the App rather than re-adding an admin bypass.

Head branches are **not** auto-deleted on merge (`delete_branch_on_merge: false`):

- The promote PR is headed by a disposable `promote/next-to-main-<run_id>` snapshot of `next`, which the workflow deletes on merge. `next` itself is never a head branch, so the back-merge never hits a missing branch.
- The back-merge runs unattended (bot App `always` bypass on the `next` ruleset). If it can't push, it opens a tracking issue — resync with a `main` → `next` PR.
- If `next` is ever missing, recreate it: `git push origin main:next`.

To change protection, edit `.github/rulesets/main.json` (or `next.json`) first — it is the
source, the live ruleset is applied from it, never the other way round. An admin then applies
it, either through `gh api` or the UI:
```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/ai-driven-dev/framework/rulesets/<id> --input .github/rulesets/main.json
```
or Settings → Rules → Rulesets → edit the ruleset by hand to match the file. Keep the file and
the live ruleset in sync either way.

## 👥 People

Roles, promotion, and inactivity rules → [`GOVERNANCE.md`](../GOVERNANCE.md#-roles). Team mechanics only:

- Maintainer ↔ `trusted-partners` team + `CODEOWNERS`.
- Core Team / Certified Member ↔ `core-team` / `certified-members` teams.

## 🛡️ Security

- Vulnerabilities: GitHub Security Advisories (see `SECURITY.md`); never a public issue.
- Secret scanning + push protection + Dependabot alerts are enabled. Push protection blocks new secret commits; it does not scan history, so never paste tokens.
- Plugin-specific runtime risks (CI permissions, MCP servers) belong in that plugin's README, not here.

## ✋ Do NOT hand-edit

- **README counts** — the hero `N plugins · N skills · N agents` block (between the `counts:start`/`counts:end` markers) and each per-plugin `N skills` span — auto-generated by `scripts/sync-readme-counts.mjs` via lefthook.
- **Per-plugin `CATALOG.md`** — auto-generated by `scripts/summarize-markdown.js` via lefthook.
- **README contributors mosaic** — the contrib.rocks image updates itself.
- **`docs/prompts-documentation.md`** — auto-generated by `scripts/summarize-markdown.js` via lefthook.

## 🛠️ Multi-tool

- The marketplace is Claude Code native.
- Other tools are served by per-release archives the `aidd-cli` builds; this repo stays Claude-authored and tool-agnostic in its prose.
- Keep tool-specific detail in plugin READMEs.
